        <h2 class="text-center font-bold uppercase text-4xl mb-4">What is <span class="italic">Democracy First! Fridays</span>?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Like the popular First Friday Art Walks that take place on the first Friday of each month, <span class="italic">Democracy First! Fridays</span> are a network of popup community events throughout Downtown Missoula that happen every Friday and are aimed at <strong>celebrating, protecting, and expanding our democratic values.</strong></p> <p clas="mb-4"> This unique time in the history of our country requires a united pushback against the ongoing dismantling of our democratic institutions. There is no other time than now for communities to engage in open discussions, artistic expression, grassroots organizing, cooperation, education, and mutual aid.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center text-4xl font-bold mt-5">A united community can make a difference.</p>
