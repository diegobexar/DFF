        <h2>What is Democracy First! Fridays?</h2>
        <p>
          Like the popular First Friday Art Walks that take place on the first Friday of each month, Democracy First! Fridays are a network of popup community events throughout Downtown Missoula with the aim at <strong>celebrating, protecting, and expanding our democratic values.</strong> This unique time in the history of our country requires a united pushback against the ongoing dismantling of our democratic institutions. There is no other time than now for communities to engage in open discussions, artistic expression, grassroots organizing, cooperation, education, and mutual aid.
        </p>
        <p>A united community can make a difference.</p>
